Your task is to reorder the characters of a string so that no two adjacent characters are the same. What is the lexicographically minimal such string?
Input
The only line has a string of length n consisting of characters A–Z.
Output
Print the lexicographically minimal reordered string where no two adjacent characters are the same. If it is not possible to create such a string, print -1.
Constraints

1<n<10^6

Example
Input:
HATTIVATTI

Output:
AHATITITVT


Idea:
We need to use a greedy approach. Lexicographically minimal means that they are sorted from left
to right based on the letters at the same index, if they are the same, we go next.
ABAZZ<ABBCD<ABBZA
This means we need to take the smallest character whenever possible.
The goal is to identify when it's not possible anymore. This key is the adjacency constraint
We need to figure out when there will be a letter count (we put the letters in a hashmap) for
a letter which will have a count bigger than all the other counts, therefore disabling us
from putting something in between, from that point on, we need to start printing it. We
need to update what this letter is on every iteration since it can change. If we did not reach
this condition, we just print the first letter in the alphabet with count>0 that was not the
letter before.
