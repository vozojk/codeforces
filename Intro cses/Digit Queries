Consider an infinite string that consists of all positive integers in increasing order:

12345678910111213141516171819202122232425...

Your task is to process q queries of the form: what is the digit at position k in the string?

Sol:

Found a great explanation. The sequence is like a skyscraper with floors representing
different lenghts of the numbers. We need to find the length of the number.
To do that we substract the number of digits with a certain length until
we get to a point where we know the number is on that floor:
indexWeSubstractedFrom - nextFloorSize < 0
Then we know the order of magnitude (power of 10) of the number;
We start at the first one i.e. 100, 1000 etc...
Then we need to find which one is it. We do that by taking the indexWeSubstractedFrom
value since now it represents the position on that floor and divide by the floor number.
This will give the actual number. Now we need to find the digit. We take the length of the number
and take the remainder of that division. This will give the index of the digit inside the number.
Then we print.
