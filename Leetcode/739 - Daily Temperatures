Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

Strategy: For this problem, we need to figure out how to store the temperatures so we can retrieve them efficiently and all of them when the current one is bigger, and therefore warrants we save how many days it has been from each of temperatures that are waiting to be beaten. A stack is ideal for this. We loop through the array of temperatures and everytime we save that temperature onto the stack, there are going to be more temperatures and none of them is going to beat the first one if it is not bigger. But if it is bigger than the first one is it certainly bigger than the others since they are smaller. Therefore a stack is ideal because the temperatures will get popped in an increasing order and we cannot miss any since they are effectivelly sorted. For each new temperature, we just check if it is not bigger than the top of the stack, if it is we pop it. The crucial thing is to save the indices of the temperatures and not the actual values since we need to know what index did the temperature have to print them out correctly, this is a clean way of achieving it. (we can access the actual temperature by just using the index in the original array...) After popping we write the different between indices of the current and past temperature in the answer vector at the correct (index in the pair) index. We have the popping logic in while(stack.back()<currentTemp) so we pop all the temperatures we can. Then we push the new one onto the stack and repeat.
