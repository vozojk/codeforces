Given an integer n, return the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than n.

Strategy: This is an optimization problem. We will TLE if we just check each number so we need to use the sieve of Eratosthenes. The concept is as follows: For each number that is not already marked, we take all of its multiple and mark them except for the number itself. We do this in an array of size n. Then after we go through all numbers upto sqrt(n) (composite proof, for num<=n is must have one of the factoes <=sqrt(n) since otherwise it would be bigger then n) we will have marked the entire array and everything unmarked was not a multiple of anything before it and is therefore prime. (we start the marking at 2 since 1 and 0 are not prime). Then, we traverse the array and count all the unmarked numbers returning the total.
