Given a positive integer n, write a function that returns the number of set bits in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight).

Strategy: An easy one, lot of different solutions but there is also one cool trick. We can use num & (num-1), now imagine the 2 numbers. For example take num=110001101, num-1=110001100, count++; this is the cool part, we now have 110001100, by deducting one, we basically shift the rightmost bit to the LSB 110001100-1=110001011 and then we AND so only the part of num that wasnt affected by the -1 stays. We get 110001100&110001011=110001000. What this does is shift the 1 to the LSB and ignores all the other ones it created since they weren't there before. It's so elegant and simple. So we just do while num!=0 and count++ for each shift we do. Then output count.
