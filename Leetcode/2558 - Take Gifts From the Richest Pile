You are given an integer array gifts denoting the number of gifts in various piles. Every second, you do the following:

Choose the pile with the maximum number of gifts.
If there is more than one pile with the maximum number of gifts, choose any.
Reduce the number of gifts in the pile to the floor of the square root of the original number of gifts in the pile.
Return the number of gifts remaining after k seconds.

Strategy: We use a priority queue to always find the largest gift pile. We do that by using the heapify algorithm which takes O(n) and then we just pick the top element K times. We keep the total sum of gifts at the start and decrease that sum by the amount we have decrease each pile evey time. We return the decreased sum.
