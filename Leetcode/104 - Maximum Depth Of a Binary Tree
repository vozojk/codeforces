Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Strategy: Just BFS, we stop if there is a nullptr. Use a queue, enqueue left and right children if not nullpointers, keep a counter in the while loop for every time we run the inner for loop. We return that since it will be the maximum height anywhere in the tree.
