You are part of a university admissions office and need to keep track of the kth highest test score from applicants in real-time. This helps to determine cut-off marks for interviews and admissions dynamically as new applicants submit their scores.

You are tasked to implement a class which, for a given integer k, maintains a stream of test scores and continuously returns the kth highest test score after a new score has been submitted. More specifically, we are looking for the kth highest score in the sorted list of all scores.

Implement the KthLargest class:

KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer k and the stream of test scores nums.
int add(int val) Adds a new test score val to the stream and returns the element representing the kth largest element in the pool of test scores so far.


Strategy: We use a priority queue. We always need to keep track of K elements that are the biggest so we use a min heap to always access the smallest one but add a new element always when it's bigger than the top of the queue. This was, after looping through the whole array, we get a queue of K grades with the top being the kth largest. This initializes the object. Then, for the add method, we just add the value and do a pop. If the value was the smallest, we pop it right back away and if it was bigger than the smallest than the smallest gets popped. We return the top of the heap at the end.
