Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.

Strategy: This one was pretty tricky. We need to save the sum of a subarray for all lengths with DP, and we keep a max integer that saves max(max, sum) each iteration to have the biggest one since the sum isn't always the biggest it could be for that length, but one of them if guaranteed to be. It is like modeling a sum function but the floor is the number at that index and we can never go below it. Max will save the maximum. The process goes as follows: We take base case dp[0]=nums[0]. Then we do a for loop through all the remaining numbers. In each iteration we either add the number to the sum, or if the sum goes into the negative, it is better to start anew since adding to a negative number doesn't help. This way, we always add numbers when it still is positive. This can be proven since for each length, we will keep the biggest number we could've gotten because for each starting point, we can be at either nums[i] or some already given sum. If this sum is positive, we know it is better to keep it.
