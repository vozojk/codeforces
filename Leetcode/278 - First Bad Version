You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

Strategy: This is obfuscated lower bound. We need to find the lower bound for the isBad function returning true. We do a basic binary search, going left half if mid is true and going right half if mid is false. We go until reaching left=right since we need the lower bound. We return left.
