Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer target, return the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to target. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.

Strategy: Classic sliding window. We keep a pointer to the left and right element of our range, if the sum is greater we do left++ to make it smaller, this happens in a while loop until it is the right size (we check sum-nums[left]>=target). The right pointer moves with the main for loop. Everytime the sum >= target we do result = min(result, currLength) to update the final length if it is smaller than the previous one. We output result. We can keep a large value like INT_MAX in result and check at the end for it to handle when the array doesn't ever reach the required target.
