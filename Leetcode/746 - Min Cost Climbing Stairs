You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of ith step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.

Strategy: This is just a different version of "70 - Climbing Stairs". DP. We calculate the minimum possible cost reach all heights. Base cases are dp[0]=cost[0] dp[1]=cost[1]. The we use that the person can make either one or two steps from each step. Therefore we will need to check 2 values from which he could've gotten there. So, dp[i]=min(dp[i-2]+cost[i], dp[i-1]+cost[i]). This ensures the minimum cost possible since it checks the entrypoints and picks the lower one. We return min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]).
