Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

Strategy: Here we use a priority queue. We create a hashmap and find the frequencies of all numbers. Then we take the priority queue and start putting in {frequency, number} pairs. We keep track of the current amount of things in the queue. When it reaches k, we start checking for each new number if its frequency is bigger than the top (its a min heap so the top is the smallest out of the queue), if it is bigger, we remove the top and add in the new element. This way, we keep the size of the underlying heap small and it will not take of lot of time to reorder (logK instead of logN). At the end, we just return all the values from the value frequency pairs from the queue.
