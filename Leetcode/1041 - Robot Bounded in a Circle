On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at (0, 0) and faces north. Note that:

The north direction is the positive direction of the y-axis.
The south direction is the negative direction of the y-axis.
The east direction is the positive direction of the x-axis.
The west direction is the negative direction of the x-axis.
The robot can receive one of three instructions:

"G": go straight 1 unit.
"L": turn 90 degrees to the left (i.e., anti-clockwise direction).
"R": turn 90 degrees to the right (i.e., clockwise direction).
The robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats them forever.

Return true if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.

Strategy: We simulate the sequence of moves by having a pos[] array with the current position and a direction[][] which saved all the possible directions of movement for better branch predictions. The key is simple. If the robot is facing the north direction at the end (the same at the start), and is not at the origin. It will never go back since each sequence it will move the same total distance in the same direction, it can never turn back. In all other directions, since the bot can turn 90,180,270 degrees this will always make him go back in every 4,2 and 4 (4*270=1080=3*360) steps and the distance traveled in each system will complement itself with the moves in separate directions which will result in them cancelling out at some point. The second, more obvious rule is that if the bot ends at the origin, it made a loop and therefore will loop.
