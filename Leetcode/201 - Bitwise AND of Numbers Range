Given two integers left and right that represent the range [left, right], return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

Strategy: This is an a-ha problem. Need to figure out the trick and then it's easy. The key is realizing that the (binary) digits that the numbers will have the same and also therefore the result of the AND operation will be the prefix that they share. It is much easier to see if we convert the problem to base-10. If I asked you what digit do the numbers ranging from 155555 to 159999 share you would say 15xxxx, it's easy since all the other ones have to cycle 1 to 0 or at least like 5 to 9 to get to the correct high bound. So we need to figure out how to get the common prefix of the bounds. I first thought I can do an AND and shift and somehow cook it up but this was a dead AND *heh*. The correct way is to simply shift the numbers right until they are the same. This gives us the digits of the prefix and by keeping count of shift we can do num<<count to get it back. This is the final result.
