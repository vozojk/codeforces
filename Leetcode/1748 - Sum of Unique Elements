You are given an integer array nums. The unique elements of an array are the elements that appear exactly once in the array.

Return the sum of all the unique elements of nums.

 Strategy: I used a hashmap. We just save the counter for all the numbers in the map and then loop through again, if the hashmap gives 1, we increase the counter. Return that.
