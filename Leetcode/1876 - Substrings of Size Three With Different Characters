A string is good if there are no repeated characters.

Given a string s, return the number of good substrings of length three in s.

Note that if there are multiple occurrences of the same substring, every occurrence should be counted.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

Strategy: I overcomplicated this so much. There is no difficult sliding window or pointer keeping. We just go through the array from 0 to size-2 (excluding) and do a simple if statement that checks if any of the letters are the same. Since there's just 3 of them. It's only 1/2 2/3 1/3 which is very simple. If the statement passes we increase a counter and move on to the next.
