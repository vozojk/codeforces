Goal:

There are n children who want to go to a Ferris wheel, and your task is to find a gondola for each child.
Each gondola may have one or two children in it, and in addition, 
the total weight in a gondola may not exceed x. You know the weight of every child.

What is the minimum number of gondolas needed for the children?

Input:
The first input line contains two integers n and x: the number of children and the maximum allowed weight.
The next line contains n integers p_1,p_2,...,p_n: the weight of each child.

Output:
Print one integer: the minimum number of gondolas.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 2*10^5
1 <= x <= 10^9
1 <= p_i <= x

Solution:
This one is easy but i was stupid :). We sort this array first.
Then, the idea is to go from the fattest child and check is a small one doesn't fit also.
We keep a pointer for the heaviest unused and lightest unused. Then in a while loop for last>=first since
that means we used all of them (the = because we do last-- at the end). If the child fits we first++,
else we move on to the next gondola. This is possible since only 2 children always fit.

I was really stupid here I tried to implement it for any number of children in 1 gondola and was mad why wasn't
my thing working. I was also stupid for not noticing this obviously wouldn't work for 2 pointers since
the matching would have to be much more complicated (we can't just use up all the small ones at the start
because they might be needed elsewhere), for example:
{9,2,2,2,2,3,4,2} for size 13
For this, the right combinations are (9,4)(2,2,2,2,2,3) with the pointers

we get: (9,2)(4,2,2,2,2)(3). Bin packing is apparently NP-Hard and very difficult to get right for large N (O(N^3))
So I wouldn't be getting that for N = 200000 any time soon...
