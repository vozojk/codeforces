Goal:
There are n applicants and m free apartments.
Your task is to distribute the apartments so that as many applicants as possible
will get an apartment.

Each applicant has a desired apartment size, and they will accept
any apartment whose size is close enough to the desired size.

Input
The first input line has three integers n, m, and k: the number of applicants,
the number of apartments, and the maximum allowed difference.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n: the desired apartment size
of each applicant. If the desired size of an applicant is x,
they will accept any apartment whose size is between x-k and x+k.

The last line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m: the size of each apartment.

Output
Print one integer: the number of applicants who will get an apartment.

Constraints

1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5
0 <= k <= 10^9
1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9

Solution:

As always, we sort both of the arrays. sort(arr.begin(), arr.end()).
The we can set up a pointer for the current size and loop through desired sizes (vice-versa also possible ig)
Since all the sizes are sorted, we just loop through desiredSizes, check for 2 things
if the currentSize is in the allowed range, we increase count and shift the currentSizePtr
If it is not we need to check if there are any people at all who would want this apartment, so
we check if the lower bound of the desiredRange isn't bigger than the current size. Since
the array is sorted we know the bound will not get smaller and we can also do ptr++
Then we print count
