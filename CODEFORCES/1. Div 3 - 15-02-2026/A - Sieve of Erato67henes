You are given n positive integers a1,a2,…,an.

Please determine if it is possible to select any number of elements in a ,so that their product is 67.

Note that you may not select zero elements, as the product of zero elements is not defined in this problem.

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤104).

The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n(1≤n≤5).

The second line of each test case contains n positive integers a1,a2,…,an - (1≤ai≤67).

Output:
If it is possible to select elements so that their product is 67,
output "YES" on one line. Otherwise, output "NO" on one line.

First CF Div 3. Did not do well at all. A was very easy, since the only thing needed
to realize is that 67 is a prime number and therefore if the array contains 67 the answer is yes.
Basic scan right from the buffer. If 67 is there, take out the rest so it's not shifted, print yes, return.
