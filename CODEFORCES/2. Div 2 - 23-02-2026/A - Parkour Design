Today, Alex wants to build a parkour course for Steve to train his parkour skills on. A parkour course is a sequence p0 -> p1 -> ... -> pk of integer coordinates on the plane. Here, a contiguous pair of coordinates is called a move, denoted as p[i-1] -> p[i].

Alex knows that Steve can only perform the following types of moves:

(xi, yi) -> (xi+2, yi+1)

(xi, yi) -> (xi+3, yi)

(xi, yi) -> (xi+4, yi-1)

Note that Steve will not perform any other type of moves. For example, Steve can perform (0,0) -> (2,1) and (2,1) -> (5,1),
but will never perform moves such as (2,1) -> (3,2), (3,0) -> (5,-1), or (4,-1) -> (6,-1) (even though they may look very easy).

You are given an integer coordinate (x,y) on the plane.

Please determine if it is possible to make a parkour course q0, q1, ..., qk that satisfies the following conditions:

q0 = (0,0)

qk = (x,y)

The parkour course only consists of moves that Steve can perform.

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 <= t <= 10^3). The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (1 <= x <= 10^9, -10^8 <= y <= 10^8).

Strategy: Just realize that the main point overall is that the Manhattan distance is always a multiple of 3, then idenfity the edge cases. The first edge was that since for y to increase by 1 x has always to increase by at least 2, this will give us 2y<=x. Then we take the other side. Since for y to descrease we need x to increase a by at least 4 we have -4y<=x. Since we have (xi, yi) -> (xi+3, yi) there are no constraints from the side of x. The problem is complete like this. This also covers all the other edge cases like x<0.
