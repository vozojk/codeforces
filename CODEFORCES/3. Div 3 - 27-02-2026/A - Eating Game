There are n players playing a game at a circular table. The i-th player has ai dishes to eat. They take turns eating the food, and any player can go first.

During their turn, if player i has any dishes remaining, they must eat exactly one dish. Then, player (imodn)+1 starts their turn. This continues until all dishes are finished.

The player who eats the last dish is considered the winner. Determine the number of players that can possibly be winners.

Input:
The first line contains an integer t(1≤t≤5000), the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1≤n≤10).

The second line of each test case contains n integers, the elements of a (1≤ai≤10).

Strategy: Since each player can use up one dish per round and each player plays once in every round, the players that have the most dishes win. So we find the maximum number in the array and count how many time it appeared there. Return that.
